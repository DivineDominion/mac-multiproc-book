# Implementing Processes

## Bootstrapping a Multi-Process Xcode Project {#bootstrap}

To create a Cocoa application is one thing. To mangle with build settings to create an app bundle with multiple components is another. I don't feel comfortable mangling with build settings still, but neither do I feel like a stranger there anymore. I don't know if that's a good sign. I'd rather have it work out of the box, but what can we do.

Let me guide you through the process of creating a project from scratch and setting everything up so it'll actually work.

### Keep Your Mac Developer Program's Team Identifier Handy

If you are enrolled to the Mac Dev Program, you got your own "team identifier." You can find it online, in Apple's Developer Center. You'll need this for the setup.

If you didn't shell out the bucks to get a license to code for Mac (yet), simply don't enable app sandboxing and don't fiddle with code signing, as both depend on valid registered developer profiles.

### Create the Targets

![New Project Settings](images/201501201655_create-project.png)

Create a new Xcode project and pick OS X "Cocoa Application". I use Swift and Core Data but no Storyboards.

Add an XPC Service target right afterwards. You find them under "Frameworks & Library" in the OS X group as of Xcode 6. We'll have to costimize the XPC Service target because nowadays it seems to work differently than people were used to. Call the future Launch Agent "Helper". We'll modify the names soon enough to make sense.

![Add the Helper Target](images/201501201656_create-helper-target.png)

Still under the "General" tab of the targets, select either Developer ID or Mac App Store signing. Using none will not work with sandboxing. But we will use sandboxing to make our app safe and future-proof and possibly App Store compatible.

Note that the XPC service target or helper target is Objective-C instead of Swift. Maybe there's a reason for it, but I wouldn't know which. We'll get it running first and translate to Swift later.

### App Capabilities: Set Up Proper Sandboxing 

Enable Sandboxing for both the app and the XPC service target.

Add an app group to let both processes communicate with each other. Pick an app group name of the form `<tem-id>.<organization>`. My organization identifier is `de.christiantietze`. I want the app components to share data, but not all apps created by me, so I want to limit the scope of the processes to the overall app group "multiproc" (for "multiple processes") for this project. My team ID is `FRMDA3XRGC`. The resulting app group I add to both targets will be `FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc`, accordingly.

![Add App Group](images/201501201701_app-groups.png)

When you add an app group, it's important you're not fooled by the `$(TeamIdentifierPrefix)` variable, which is the default value. This variable will likely [be `nil` during development][teamidnil]. That should be okay when you write XPC helper processes which are launched by the app itself on demand.[^helperex] But it only causes you pain when you work with login items and try to connect to a system-wide Mach-Service. Put your team identifier in there manually to make things work during development. Don't ask me why, but it's [the only way I got this running][ctde-appgroup] during development.

Although the docs don't say it, I found the app group needs to be a substring of both target's bundle identifiers. The XPC Service is currently called `de.christiantietze.Helper`, which won't do. Rename both processes so that the bundle component `multiproc.` is in there.

[ctde-appgroup]: http://christiantietze.de/posts/2015/01/xpc-helper-sandboxing-mac/

[^helperex]: If you are interested in leveraging XPC to put heavy work into helper processes and take the load from your main application, the online periodical objc.io #14 features [a very good article about XPC helper services](http://www.objc.io/issue-14/xpc.html) for you.

### Make the XPC Service a Launch Agent

Launch Agents have to be placed in the `.app` bundle's `Contents/Library/LoginItems` subfolder. Their name has to equal the bundle name. Launch Services will create the appropriate Mach-Service to connect to on our behalf this way.

* Search for "Product Name" in the Helper's build settings tab and set it to `<team-id>.<bundle-name>`. In my case, this is: `FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper`.
* Change the value of the "Wrapper Name" build setting to "app" instead of "xpc". Although the docs say Launch Agents may not end with `.app`, it didn't work for me.
* Modify the XPC Sercvice's `.plist`: replace the value of "Bundle Identifier" with `$(PRODUCT_NAME)` only, no RFC escaping, no organization prefix. The RFC-escaped version would replace the bundle identifier's delimiting periods with dashes. That'd not be good.
* Delete "Embed XPC Service" build phase. We're not just splitting an app into XPC components but want to create a Launch Agent and need to meet other criteria.
* Add a copy file build phase. Destination: "Wrapper". Subpath: "Contents/Library/LoginItems". Drag and drop the helper target's product alias in there. (You find build products to your left in the Standard Editor's "related files" section below the "Products" group.)

### A Note on Maintaining the Launch Agent's Target

When you install Launch Agents manually, you put them into `~/Library/LaunchServices/` and call `launchctl load`, followed by the file name. To stop using an Agent, you call `launchctl unload`, followed by the Agent's file name again.

This doesn't work in our case since we automate launching the process and keep the file in our app bundle.

To not only stop execution (which results in relaunching the Agent) but remove the Agent from the list (like `unload` does usually), you have to use the `remove` command. `launchctl remove` removes not by file name, but by service name. In my case, I stop and get rid of the helper process with the following command from the Terminal:

{linenos=no}
    launchctl remove FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper

To make changes take effect after building a new version of the helper, `stop` will suffice to reload the service, though:

{linenos=no}
    launchctl stop FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper

You can automate this with Xcode build scripts to get rid of the helper with every run. This is especially useful for the early development.

## Implement a communication API

By now, both app targets should compile. They don't do anything, though. You should be able to invoke the helper application manually, too. Now let's add means to make the main app start the helper if it isn't running.

I will guide you through the process of creating your own interacting processes from scratch in this section.

If you want to have a look at the outcome of this only and find the step-by-step guide too long, just download the [demo app's code after the adaptation from GitHub]201501221730github and look at the result. See you in [the next section](#sec:xpcconcepts)!


### Define a shared protocol

To set up the `NSXPCConnection`, we need to supply a protocol to communicate with the helper by proxy.

I like to give protocols names which state capabilities. Instead of `XPCHelperProtocol` or something I am going to use `ProvidesCounts` for now:

{linenos=no}
    @protocol ProvidesCounts
    - (void)currentCountWithReply:(void (^)(NSUInteger))reply;
    @end

I put `ProvidesCounts.h` into a source file group called "Shared Sources" at root level. Both targets will use this.

The helper's target, being Objective-C anyway, can simply import the file.

The Swift target, though, needs bridging headers. They are used to import Objective-C stuff into the Swift module. Create a file called `<app-product-name>-Bridging-Header.h` in the Swift app module. In my case, this is called `MultiProcCounter-Bridging-Header.h`, with "MultiProcCounter" being the target's and the bundle's name. Next, modify this target's build settings. Search for "bridging headers" and set "Objective-C Bridging Headers" of the product to `<product-path>/<product-name>-Bridging-Header.h`. In my case, this is `MultiProcCounter/MultiProcCounter-Bridging-Header.h`. The path is relative to the group. Usually, the folder is called the same as the product/target when you create it. Now, import the protocol in this bridging header:

{linenos=no}
    #import "ProvidesCounts.h"

That's it for the Swift-based target.

The helper's template includes the `Agent` protocol which we don't need anymore. The sample helper object, mine is called `MultiProcCounterHelper`, just like the service's target, has to implement `ProvidesCounts` instead.

    // MultiProcCounterHelper.h
    @interface MultiProcCounterHelper : NSObject <ProvidesCounts>
    @end

    // MultiProcCounterHelper.m
    @implementation MultiProcCounterHelper
    - (void)currentCountWithReply:(void (^)(NSUInteger))reply
    {
        reply(1337);
    }
    @end

Replacing the `Agent` protocol with `ProvidesCounts` in the helper's `main.m` where necessary, we end up with a `ServiceDelegate` which actually becomes the listener for XPC connections:

    // main.m
    @interface ServiceDelegate : NSObject <NSXPCListenerDelegate>
    @end

    @implementation ServiceDelegate
    - (BOOL)listener:(NSXPCListener *)listener shouldAcceptNewConnection:(NSXPCConnection *)newConnection {
        newConnection.exportedInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(ProvidesCounts)];
        MultiProcCounterHelper *exportedObject = [MultiProcCounterHelper new];
        newConnection.exportedObject = exportedObject;
        [newConnection resume];
    
        return YES;
    }
    @end

### Make use of the shared protocol

Now tweak `AppDelegate` to connect to the helper and obtain a value. The client application will set up the connection like this:

{title='Listing 1.1: AppDelegate.swift using NSXPCConnection'}
    @NSApplicationMain
    class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {

        @IBOutlet weak var window: NSWindow!
        var helper: ProvidesCounts?

        func applicationDidFinishLaunching(aNotification: NSNotification) {
            var error: NSError?
            // I'll show you what createXPCConnection() looks like in a moment.
            let maybeConnection = createXPCConnection("FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper.app", &error)
            if (maybeConnection == nil) {
                NSLog("connection failed %@", error!.description)
                return
            }
            let connection = maybeConnection!
        
            connection.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
            connection.resume()
        
            helper = connection.remoteObjectProxyWithErrorHandler() { (err) -> Void in
                NSLog("Failed to send message: %@\n\n", err.description)
            } as? ProvidesCounts
        
            if helper == nil {
                NSLog("No helper")
            }
        
            helper!.currentCountWithReply() { (result) -> Void in
                NSLog("The result is: \(result)")
            }
        }
    }

There's a lot of `NSLog`ging going on for now. Of course this is going to be replaced by real error-handling mechanisms. You should be aware of the possible points of failure: starting up the service may fail. Or it starts up but the XPC connection doesn't work and you don't get a proxy object. Or you get a proxy object, but sending the message fails because the service crashes in between.
<!--ct: TODO when do you not get a remoteObjectProxyWithErrorHandler()? Outdated versions?-->

### XPC connection factory

I used a little helper method here, `createXPCConnection()`, which takes the file name of the helper app. I adapted it from Apple's own demo code [AppSandboxLoginItemXPCDemo][xpcdemo]. Instead of extending `NSXPCConnection` and supplying a new convenience initializer, I used a factory function here. Mostly because the initializer wouldn't compile for reason I cannot fathom.

    func createXPCConnection(loginItemName: NSString, error: NSErrorPointer) -> NSXPCConnection? {
        let mainBundleURL = NSBundle.mainBundle().bundleURL
        let loginItemDirURL = mainBundleURL.URLByAppendingPathComponent("Contents/Library/LoginItems", isDirectory: true)
        let loginItemURL = loginItemDirURL.URLByAppendingPathComponent(loginItemName)
    
        return createXPCConnection(loginItemURL, error)
    }

The actual factory called here takes a URL instead of a file name.

{title='Listing 1.2: createXPCConnection() factory'}
    // Since Swift doesn't care about ancient Boolean types, create convenience
    // constants for later. (SMLoginItemSetEnabled will need these.)
    let TRUE: Boolean = 1 as Boolean
    let FALSE: Boolean = 0 as Boolean
    
    func createXPCConnection(loginItemURL: NSURL, error: NSErrorPointer) -> NSXPCConnection? {
        let loginItemBundle = NSBundle(URL: loginItemURL)
    
        if loginItemBundle == nil { // ❶
            // populate error pointer ...
            return nil
        }
    
        if loginItemBundle!.bundleIdentifier? == nil { // ❷
            // populate error pointer ...
            return nil
        }
        let loginItemBundleId = loginItemBundle!.bundleIdentifier!
    
        let loginItemBaseName = loginItemURL.lastPathComponent!.stringByDeletingPathExtension
        if loginItemBundleId != loginItemBaseName { // ❸
            // populate error pointer ...
            return nil
        }
    
        if SMLoginItemSetEnabled(loginItemBundleId as CFString, TRUE) != TRUE { // ❹
            // populate error pointer ...
            return nil
        }
    
        return NSXPCConnection(machServiceName: loginItemBundleId, options: NSXPCConnectionOptions(0))
    }

1. Load the bundle at the specified URL.
2. Lookup the bundle identifier for the login item. LaunchServices implicitly registers a mach service for the login item whose name is the name as the login item's bundle identifier.
3. The login item's file name must match its bundle Id.
4. Enable the login item. This will start it running if it wasn't already running.

If all of this works, we get an XPC connection.

That's a lot of checks and a lot of things which can go wrong. Good news is: all of these are programmer errors. If you distribute the app properly, they won't surprisingly happen in the wild.

### Getting rid of Objective-C code in favor of Swift

The XPC service target's code is in Objective-C by default. I don't know why, though. [Other folks][adf-swift] on the Apple Developer Forums use Swift for their XPC service without issues, and so will we. 

Here's what you have to do to get rid of Objective-C code altogether:

* Set "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code" in the helper's build settings to "YES" to use Swift in the first place.
* Delete all `.h` and `.m` files, including the shared protocol and bridging headers.
* Add a `HelperServices.swift` file which will contain the shared protocol. Both the app and the helper target need to use this. See listing 1.3 below.[^namespaces]
* Add a `main.swift` file to the helper with the code of the listing 1.4 below.
* Compile and run and rejoice.

{title='Listing 1.3: HelperServices.swift'}
    import Foundation

    @objc(ProvidesCounts)
    protocol ProvidesCounts {
        func currentCount(reply: ((UInt) -> Void)!)
    }


{title='Listing 1.4: main.swift (in XPC Service's Target)'}

    import Cocoa

    class TheHelper : NSObject, ProvidesCounts {
        func currentCount(reply: ((UInt) -> Void)!) {
            reply(4455)
        }
    }

    class ServiceDelegate : NSObject, NSXPCListenerDelegate {
        func listener(listener: NSXPCListener!, shouldAcceptNewConnection newConnection: NSXPCConnection!) -> Bool {
            newConnection.exportedInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
            var exportedObject = TheHelper()
            newConnection.exportedObject = exportedObject
            newConnection.resume()
            return true
        }
    }

    let bundleId = NSBundle.mainBundle().bundleIdentifier!
    let delegate = ServiceDelegate()
    let listener = NSXPCListener(machServiceName: bundleId)
    listener.delegate = delegate;
    listener.resume()
    NSRunLoop.currentRunLoop().run()

I like the Swift version better, mainly because the code is a lot more terse for what it accomplishes.

[^namespaces]: It'd be cool if you could easily create Swift modules as namespaces to share code. But creating a `.swiftmodule` manually [takes too many steps](http://railsware.com/blog/2014/06/26/creation-of-pure-swift-module/) to pay off for sharing a single protocol between two targets.

[adf-swift]: https://devforums.apple.com/message/1092054#1092054

### Recap

When the project is prepared, you need to perform the following steps in code to get the XPC service up and running and have the client app connect to it:

* Define a protocol to use on both sides: the XPC service has to provide an object which implements the protocol while the client uses the proxy object. I called this protocol `ProvidesCounts`.
* Add bridging headers to Swift targets to make the protocol available there.
* Expose the object which implements the protocol in the `NSXPCListener` implementation, here in `ServiceDelegate`. Use `NSXPCInterface`'s `exportedObject` property for this.
* On the client side, start the XPC service as a login item via `SMLoginItemSetEnabled()`.
* Then obtain the result of the connection's `remoteObjectProxyWithErrorHandler()`, cast it to your shared protocol, here `ProvidesCounts`, and use it like any other object.

Run the app and see what happens. In my case, it prints the number to the console as expected. Congratulations! This was a lot of effort for not very much. But we're getting to grips with the new API, so we can roll more quickly and add real application logic, soon.

If you didn't follow along in your code, check out the demo app [with changes this far][201501221730github].

[201501221730github]: https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-multiproc-code/tree/001-xpc-bootstrapping

## XPC API Concepts {#sec:xpcconcepts}

So far, we've managed to get a project with a logon helper service up and running. We connected the application (the client) to the XPC service.

XPC services are designed to handle multiple clients. Each connection will go through the service's connection delegate and can obtain its own proxy object instance. Or you could share an instance between connections if you want.

The point is: the XPC service is designed to dispatch whatever it does asynchronously. You only have to do the following:

1. Create an `NSXPCConnection` and `resume()` it. This will prepare the connection.
2. Obtain a `remoteObjectProxy()`. This will establish the connection inasmuch as actual data is sent back and forth.

Afterwards, the XPC service's exported object will do its thing and you don't have to worry about the connection itself anymore.



### Make the connection bi-directional

We have queried the XPC service successfully. But how do the client apps get notified when the shared data store is changed to update the user interface? We could either use `NSDistributedNotifications` to broadcast changes or make the XPC connection bi-directional.

Bi-directional XPC Connections are symmetrical. Both specify their expectations through a `remoteObjectInterface` and supply an `exportedObject`.

So far, on the client side, things looks like this:

{linenos=no}
    connection.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
    connection.resume()

And on the server side:

{linenos=no}
    newConnection.exportedInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
    var exportedObject = TheHelper()
    newConnection.exportedObject = exportedObject
    newConnection.resume()

Now if the client exports an object itself to the XPC service, we simply have to do something similar:

    connection.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
    connection.exportedInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: Listener.self)
    connection.exportedObject = self // This currently is AppDelegate
    connection.resume()

And the XPC service will need to know about the `remoteObjectInterface`:

    newConnection.exportedInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
    var exportedObject = TheHelper()
    newConnection.exportedObject = exportedObject
    newConnection.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: Listener.self)
    newConnection.resume()

This new `Listener` protocol is pretty simple: it receives an integer. The client application will simply print the number it receives to the console so we can see that it works as advertised.

    @objc(Listener)
    protocol Listener {
        func updateTicker(tick: Int)
    }

Right after accepting the connection, the XPC service will initiate a ticker to send some numbers without being asked by the client first:

    class ServiceDelegate : NSObject, NSXPCListenerDelegate {
        func listener(listener: NSXPCListener!, shouldAcceptNewConnection newConnection: NSXPCConnection!) -> Bool {
            newConnection.exportedInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: ProvidesCounts.self)
            var exportedObject = TheHelper()
            newConnection.exportedObject = exportedObject
            newConnection.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(`protocol`: Listener.self)
        
            var valid = true
        
            newConnection.invalidationHandler = {
                valid = false
                NSLog("invalidated")
            }

            newConnection.resume()
            
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(0, 0)) {
                // Retrieve the object from the client which responds to the
                // protocol we've just defined.
                let listener = newConnection.remoteObjectProxyWithErrorHandler({ 
                    error in
            
                    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
                        NSLog("error in the connection: \(error.description)")
                    }
                }) as Listener
        
                // Every 5 seconds until invalidated or the sequence has finished,
                // send a number across the connection.
                for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    NSThread.sleepForTimeInterval(5)
                    
                    // We have to abort the process if the connection 
                    // is invalidated, or else the loop will continue.
                    if (!valid) {
                        NSLog("aborting")
                        break
                    }
                    
                    NSLog("Sending \(i)")
                    listener.updateTicker(i)
                }
            }
        
            return true
        }
    }

Now if we start the demo app which launches the service, too, this is the console output when we quit the app during the process after a few seconds:

    FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper[6249]: accepting connection
    MultiProcCounter[6246]: The result is: 4455
    FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper[6249]: Sending 0
    MultiProcCounter[6246]: Tick #0
    FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper[6249]: Sending 1
    MultiProcCounter[6246]: Tick #1
    FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper[6249]: Sending 2
    MultiProcCounter[6246]: Tick #2
    
    CoreServicesUIAgent[336]: unexpected message <OS_xpc_error: <error: 0x7fff74b92c60> { count = 1, contents =
    	"XPCErrorDescription" => <string: 0x7fff74b92f70> { length = 18, contents = "Connection invalid" }
    }>
    
    FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper[6249]: invalidated
    FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper[6143]: aborting
    

Notice that the second to last entry is a log message by `CoreServicesUIAgent`, reporting an invalidated connection as `OS_xpc_error`. The helper aborts the process when it received the invalidation message.

See [the sample code at this stage](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-multiproc-code/tree/edea24f454aeff1a0a91739e5359c7682e270415) or [just the changes](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-multiproc-code/commit/edea24f454aeff1a0a91739e5359c7682e270415).

### Handle connection interruptions

> You'll typically have interruption handlers in your application and invalidation handlers in you xpc service.
> ---[@CocoaKevin](http://blog.yvs.eu.com/2013/07/cocoa-interprocess-communication-with-xpc/)


We've already got to know `invalidationHandler` in the last example. This callback is used when the client application crashes, for example. When the connection is invalidated, you can't use the `NSXPCConnection` instance anymore. It wouldn't make sense otherwise: what could recovery from a crashed client application look like anyway?

For the other side of the connection, there's also an `interruptionHandler` property, which you will need for the client app. If you shutdown the XPC service while the connection is open, the connection won't be invalidated. It will merely be interrupted.

The applicatian can recover from interruptions. Recall that `launchd` manages XPC service lifecycles and takes care for re-launching crashed services. You can use the existing connection to perform additional queries.

From [the docs][errordoc]:

>     The handler is invoked on the same queue as reply messages and other handlers, and it is always executed after any other messages or reply block handlers (except for the invalidation handler). It is safe to make new requests on the connection from an interruption handler.
> 
> *   Invalidation handler---called when the invalidate method is called or when an XPC helper could not be started. When this handler is called, the local connection object is no longer valid and must be recreated.
>     
>     This is always the last handler called on a connection object. When this block is called, the connection object has been torn down. It is not possible to send further messages on the connection at that point, whether inside the handler or elsewhere in your code.

For some bi-directional connections, it is advisable to provide both interruption and invalidation handlers. The connections which qualify are probably anonymous connections, where two clients connect to an XPC service (server) and exchange connection tokens to finally connect to each other. That's a very cool feature, but it goes beyond the scope of this book and its example project.

So we'll stick to providing interruption handler on the client side, and invalidation handler for the XPC service's side.

### Remove the old Helper process automatically with every build during initial development

When you get started with developing the processes, it's going to get on your nerves to manually shut down or restart the background process all the time. Instead, add a script to your build phases to stop the process on every build.

{linenos=no, title="Remove old Helper Script Build Phase"}
    if launchctl list | grep de.christiantietze.multiproc; then
        echo "Removing Helper…"
        launchctl remove FRMDA3XRGC.de.christiantietze.multiproc.Helper
    else
        echo "No Helper was Running."
    fi

This is not what you are going to want later on, but it'll suffice to get past the initial trouble. To restart or shut down the helper manually, you can create an Automator service to execute this script and add a shortcut to it. Or use a script launcher like Keyboard Maestro.

By all means: do yourself a favor and don't use the Terminal directly everytime.

## Testing XPC Calls: Define Adapters

So far, we've tested the XPC connection by starting both the background service and a client app. This is cumbersome, and it's hard to automate.

Now that we've gained confidence in the project's principal setup, we can step back and stop with these learning tests. We've learned how XPC connections basically work. Now we're ready to develop the application itself. To do so, we'll make use of automatted tests.

Testing an XPC connection is no different from testing user interaction in view controllers.

To test if a view controller has set up a button correctly, you see if loading its view populates the button's `IBOutlet` property. If it isn't nil, the view is correctly connected in the Nib. Next, you test the action by inspecting the button. You don't perform a real click. Instead, you see if the button is connected to the right `IBAction`. Then you test the behavior of the action method in question.

We can do the same for XPC: verify the connection, verify the set up and flow of information, and verify the behavior.

In detail, this means:

1. **Verify connection.** When a connection request comes in to the background service, what does it do? When should it accept the connection? How does it set up the `NSXPCConnection` instance? 
2. **Verify set up & flow of information.** The background service will assign an object which the clients have access to through their object proxy. Is the correct object assigned? Does it respond to the requests which will be made? `exportedObject` doesn't utilize strong typing to help us not pass the wrong kind of object. We have to verify this ourselves.
3. **Verify behavior.**  When we receive a call through an XPC connection, how do the objects on our end react? Test for behavior, just as you do with unit tests anyway.

That's for the receiving end. The client code will have to take similar measures: set up the connection object, send a request, and test behavior depending on the result.

Both the client and the service have to take interruptions and invalidations into account, respectively.

To get this far, it helps to think about the concrete API we are going to use.

<!--ct: TODO add image of interfaces-->

* The client will be notified when the total capacity left reaches 0.
* The service will receive requests for ordering new boxes.
* The service will receive requests for assigning an item to existing boxes. This could fail if no boxes are present or all are full.
* The service will receive requests for deleting particular items and boxes. This too could fail if boxes are non-empty.


    @objc(ManagesBoxesAndItems)
    public protocol ManagesBoxesAndItems {
        func provisionBox(label: String, capacity: Int)
        func provisionItem(name: String, inBoxWithIdentifier boxIdentifier: IntegerId)
        func removeBox(boxIdentifier: IntegerId)
        func removeItem(itemIdentifier: IntegerId, fromBoxIdentifier boxIdentifier: IntegerId)
    }
    
    @objc(UsesBoxesAndItems)
    protocol UsesBoxesAndItems {
        func receiveBox(boxData: NSDictionary)
        func receiveItem(itemData: NSDictionary)
        
        func allowAddingItems()
        func forbidAddingItems()
    }

`IntegerId` is a type alias to `Int64` or 64 bit integer. We can't use real ID values here, which are represented as structs, because Objective-C doesn't understand structs. Instead of making classes out of them, I opted in to transferring the most primitive data possible.

This is the API for both ways. Now that it is established, the application parts will be able to make use of it and grow.

In the next part, we're going to actually implement the client apps and the background service using these protocols as means of communication.

## Dealing with crashes
* Launch Services takes care of restarting the helper
* add a lock-like token to find out if it crashed or if it was quit on purpose
* inform the user from the UI processes (background status item, or main app)
