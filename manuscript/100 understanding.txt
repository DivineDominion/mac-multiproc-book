-# Understanding the Problem: Why You Would Want to Separate Your App Into Processes

# Motivation

## Separating Concerns

* multi-part app
    * background process
    * big UI, i.e. the main app
    * helper UI, i.e. the menu bar app

## Shared Data VS Inter-Process Communication

* coming from a monolithic app approach: all processes should share data, but how do you accomplish this?
    * shared static snapshot may lead to data anomalies due to multiple clients and concurrent access
    * but maybe it's not so bad after all if the DBMS takes care of concurrency and we can make sure that changes take effect eventually
