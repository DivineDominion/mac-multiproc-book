# Preparing the Architecture

## A bit of Domain-driven Design Vocabulary Recap

## Bounded Contexts

## Aggregates

## Rephrasing the problem: integrating Bounded Contexts

## Sharing Data and Eventual Consistency

## Design for concurrency

### Don't expect immediate responses

* calls accross the XPC connection should be non-blocking
    * the app should stay responsive to user interaction
    * the helper should stay responsive to further requests
* favor commands and react to callbacks, taking a delay into account
    * instead of asking the helper for a BoxId to create stuff on the client side, command it to create a Box and wait for the response
    * if you want to give immediate feedback to the user, create a temporary view component and command the service to create a Box for a given temporary identifier and incorporate the changes later (isn't this much like a real identifier already? only benefit: it's vended this side of the connection)
