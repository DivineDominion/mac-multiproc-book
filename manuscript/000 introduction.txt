-# Introduction

## A Note on this Preview Version

Thanks for buying this book in its "beta" version. You'll receive free lifetime updates to this book. I expect to finish the text and code by summer 2015. Until then, consider us a team to finish this thing.

I decided to include all chapters and sections in this preview even though I haven't written a single word for them so you can get a glimpse of what's coming next.

For this book project, I want to be as open as possible from the very beginning. I want to incorporate your valuable feedback to write the best book on the topic _you_ could ever own.

## How to Read the Book

I wrote this book systematically. You can read from start to finish and follow the planning and development process. If you're interested in code, jump right ahead to [part 3](#part_program).

These are the parts, in short:

1. Why separate an application into multiple processes? What are the conceptual and practical gains?
2. Solving the problem of inter-process communication: what are your options, and why I think you should pick XPC.
3. How to write software made up of components. Writing the user interface apps and the XPC background service.
4. Discussion of the findings.
5. Appendix, with interesting links and books to read, and general troubleshooting advice.

There'll be a lot of references to software architecture and design patterns. As a convention, uppercase denotes a pattern name, and its first time appearance is emboldened. Examples: **Entity**, Repository, Ubiquituous Language, **Factory**, Value Object.
