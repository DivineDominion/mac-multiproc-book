# Organizing the Database

* Shared database with Core Data and concurrent access
    * You're locked into Core Data from then onward
    * handle backgrounding via `jetsam`: remove file presenters; don't use NSFileCoordinator at all https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2408/_index.html
* What is Event Sourcing?
* Use multiple data stores: separate reading from writing
    * CQRS

## Data Storage Options

* realm.io: does support access from multiple threads/queues, but doesn't support access in concurrent processes <http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/0.89.2/#realm-files-cannot-be-accessed-by-concurrent-processes>
